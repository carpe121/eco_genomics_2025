# Transcriptomics Notes

This `.md` file will keep my notes on server activities during the transcriptomics module. 

## October 7

Began transcriptomics unit. Began with cleaning RNA sequencing reads from new study species, *P. tonsa*, using Fastp within the script `fastp_tonsa.sh`. My sample is **C1R**.

## October 9
Returned to `fastp_tonsa.sh` and completed cleaning reads. Cleaned reads were passed to the shell script `salmon_quant.sh`.
